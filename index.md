# Description

Snatch is a social platform that enables people to find social groups according to their interests. With Snatch, people who want to be active member in a social group are no longer need to search on the internet by also considering their reachable area. Snatch recommends the suitable groups for its users. Groups will have an environment in which they can chat, send documents, make checklists, make promotion, organize meetings and open voting. In this way, one way or another, all the members of a specific group can be kept in touch. Group administrators will be able to get company recommendations which may sponsor their events or be partner for a specific event. These company recommendations will be done according to companies’ budgets for an event, companies’ field of studies and locations of the companies and events.  Communities may also express that they might provide sponsorships and look for proper events.
