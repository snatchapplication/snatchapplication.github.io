# Description

Snatch is a platform that enables people to organize their social activities according to their locations and also groups that they want to participate in. Since it is a location based program, location is specified after the completion of registering process. To join a group such as FRP clubs, one need to specify interests for that. After that, available groups will become visible to them and they can send a request to group that they want to participate in. Only group admins have ability to confirm or reject the requests. A group can be selected whether it is an announcement group where only admins can write something or ordinary chat. In this way, one way or another, all the members of a specific group can be kept in touch. People could take different roles at different groups in Snatch. Groups will have an environment in which they can chat, send documents, make checklists, make promotion, organize meetings and open voting. Group administrators will be able to get company recommendations which may sponsor their events or be partner for a specific event. These company recommendations will be done according to companies’ budgets for an event, companies’ field of studies and locations of the companies and events.  Communities may also express that they might provide sponsorships and look for proper events.
